## ✨ Getting Started

- Make sure you already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.
- You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). After creating an account, [grab your key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
- Then, under the `src` directory, go to `api/OpenWeatherService` and replace `WEATHER_API_KEY`  with your OpenWeatherMap API Key for weekly weather Forcasst. And for Current weather replace `API_URL` with your Laravel Backend Url.
  - **`api/OpenWeatherService.js`**: It contains the code related to the back-end of the application.
